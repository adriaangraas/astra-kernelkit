journal = {Biomedical Physics \& Engineering Express},
abstract = {In this article the Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction (TIGRE) Toolbox, a MATLAB/CUDA toolbox for fast and accurate 3D x-ray image reconstruction, is presented. One of the key features is the implementation of a wide variety of iterative algorithms as well as FDK, including a range of algorithms in the SART family, the Krylov subspace family and a range of methods using total variation regularization. Additionally, the toolbox has GPU-accelerated projection and back projection using the latest techniques and it has a modular design that facilitates the implementation of new algorithms. We present an overview of the structure and techniques used in the creation of the toolbox, together with two usage examples. The TIGRE Toolbox is released under an open source licence, encouraging people to contribute.}
