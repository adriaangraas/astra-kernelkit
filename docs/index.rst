Welcome to ASTRA KernelKit's documentation!
===================================

**ASTRA KernelKit** is a Python library for ``cooks`` and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It pulls data from the `Open Food
Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.


Try ASTRA KernelKit yourself, visit `installation <install/>`.

.. warning::
   This project is under active development, and the **API is not
   stable yet**.  If you have any questions, please open an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/adriaangraas/astra-kernelkit>`_.


.. note::
   For **ASTRA Toolbox** (with Python and MatLab interfaces), visit `<https://astra-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. The KernelKit package is geared towards developers.
