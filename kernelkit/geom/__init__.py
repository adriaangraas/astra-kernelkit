        with None for unknown dimensions.
    projection_geometry : ProjectionGeometry, optional
        A projection geometry, by default None. Is used to suggest the
        volume extent in case insufficient information can be deduced from
        the other parameters.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Whether to print the parameters solving process, by default False.

    -----
     - Currently only volume geometries with isotropic voxels are deduced.
